# On the OVERVIEW, people can see all the events available in a certain area around them
# Through a button, they can access the DETAIL page, where more details and services are available.
#
# To add a new event, the button "Create Event" on the OVERVIEW leads the user to a form,
# where all information can be typed in. After sending the form, the event is directly
# available on the overview (at least in this UI prototype)
